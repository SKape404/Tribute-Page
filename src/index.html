    <b> The Journey from Suiting Up to Facing the Mad Titan</b>
    <ul class="center">
      <li> In a cave in Afghanistan, Tony Stark and Ho Yinsen developed the first Iron Man suit, which Stark used to escape his captors. </li>
      <li> Fighting alongside the Avengers for the first time, Iron Man nearly sacrificed himself in order to save New York. </li>
      <li> Stark was nearly killed when an attack by the supposed Mandarin destroyed his home, sending him plummeting into the sea. </li>
      <li> Already on opposite sides of a fight over the Sokovia Accords, Iron Man unleashed his full fury on Captain America and Bucky when he learned the truth about his parentsâ€™ death. </li>
      <li> On the planet Titan, Iron Man, alongside several allies, took on Thanos in a bid to stop the Titan from gaining all of the Infinity Stones. </li>
